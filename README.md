HTML and CSS code creates a festive "Happy Diwali" display with fireworks animations and text styling. It has both dynamic animations for fireworks and a celebratory message. Below is an overview of what your code does:

HTML Structure:
Container: Holds the title and fireworks elements.
Title: Displays "ADVANCE Happy Diwali" with large text at the center.
Fireworks: Multiple elements to create the firework animation using CSS.

CSS Styling:
Fonts and Styling: You applied a custom font via Google Fonts (though the URL seems to be incomplete), black background, and center-aligned text with shadows for the "ADVANCE Happy Diwali" message.
Fireworks Animation: Each .firework uses radial gradients to simulate particles and is animated with @keyframes to create a firework effect. These fireworks change size, opacity, and position in cycles, giving the illusion of an exploding firework.

Improvements/Suggestions:
1.Font Import Fix: The current Google Fonts URL seems to be broken. You might want to fix it like this:

CSS
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Agbalumo&family=Dokdo&family=Joti+One&family=Neucha&display=swap');

2.Enhancing Firework Animation: The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used creatively to make the fireworks more complex. To add more variety, you can experiment with more delay timings, colors, or even additional shapes for a greater visual effect.

3.Accessibility: You can include alt text for non-text elements (like fireworks) or a more descriptive heading to make the page accessible to screen readers.

4.Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure the layout scales well for smaller devices. Consider using relative units (vmin, vmax, vw, vh) more consistently for better responsiveness.
